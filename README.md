## Technologies

The project is built using React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

React was chosen because of the ease of use, my familiarity with it, and the ability to create reusable components, it also has a large community and a lot of resources available which could have helped in case I needed to add more interactivity to the project.

Typescript was chosen because of the ability to catch errors at compile time and the ability to create type definitions for the project.

Tailwind CSS was chosen because of its ease of use, my familiarity with it and because it can help prototype much faster.

I also added prettier to the project, which helps me stay focused on the code and not get distracted by the formatting.
